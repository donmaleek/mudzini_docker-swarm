## Introduction

Mudzini Docker Swarm is a robust container orchestration platform designed to enhance Docker's native capabilities. It simplifies container management, improves scalability, reliability, and security, and is suitable for developers, IT operations teams, and businesses managing containerized applications. The project supports microservices architectures, automated service discovery, and ensures high availability.
